3. linked_list.py
4. main.py
5. median_of_medians.py
6. randomized_select.py
7. rooted_trees.py
8. stack_queue.py

To simulate a run for the median of medians and Randomized select. Run the main.py file.<br>
To change the size of the generated arrays for the sort simulation add a new ***"size"*** int value on line 10 to your liking in the array.

Run arrays_and_matrices.py and you will get a small runs of both of the data structure.<br>
Run linked_list.py and you will get a small runs of both of the data structure.<br>
Run stack_queue.py and you will get a small runs of both of the data structure.<br>
